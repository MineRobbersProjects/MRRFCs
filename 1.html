    <br>
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>CCFTP is a program/protocol that allows files to be transferred from one capable device to another capable device. A "capable device", in this context, is an in-game device capable of storing files.</p>
    <h3>2. Connection</h3>
    <p>In order to establish a connection with a "server", the client must send it a "ccftp:connect" message. This message will let the server know that the client wishes to connect.</p>
